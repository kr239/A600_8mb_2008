# A600_8mb_2008
My old A600 memory expansion project, as of 2008, released under GPL v3 license.


Changes made for the release:

 - the whole PCB project was converted to pcad2006 format.

 - PCB design fixed for being like a single PCB, needs manual breaking after manufacturing.

 - gerber files are generated. WARNING: I haven't tested them in production! Use at your own risk.

 - Schematics converted to .pdf file.

 ----- added .bom file.
